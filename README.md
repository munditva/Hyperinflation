# Hyperinflation

This is an original project on finding the causes of Hyperinflation in Venezuela using data published by the World Bank. I have emphasized on discussions involving the way out of the hyperinflation crisis in Venzuela.

Code for the data analysis can be reviewed with Ven.ipynb and the required data can be downloaded from Ven.csv

Happy reading!
